Setup instructions (hints):

Hints: if Eclipse doesn't work the way you expect, here's the usual suspects of Eclipse: 
	clean, close&open project, restart using -clean flag... 
	
	When eclipse is complaining about maven dependency jars: Please make sure that the given dependency 
	jar file is "visible" inside the eclipse project ("Maven Dependencies").
		If jar file dependency is missing: make sure to run ../mp2Dbuilder/installCDKIntoMaven followed by
		AND/OR project right-click->Maven->Update Dependencies.
		If jar file is present, but pom.xml is marked red: try editing the pom file, then Undo and Save 
		before running "clean project".
	


Make sure Maven2 Eclipse plugin is installed:
	Eclipse update site: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update/
		Choose the following optional stuff (just to make sure):
			Central Repository index
			Integration for WTP
			POM Editor
			POM XML Editor

Apply jchempaint patches
	If there are patch files in the same directory as this readme file, then they should be applied
	to the jchempaint project:
	
	e.g. git am 0001-Added-generation-of-java-source-jars.patch  
	

Add jchempaint jars to local Maven repo

	cd mp2Dbuilder/.. (jchempaint directory is assumed to be placed parallel with this project)
	git clone http://pele.farmbio.uu.se/git/cdk-jchempaint.git/
	cd cdk-jchempaint
	git checkout origin/13-bioclipse2.1.x -b bioclipse
	ant clean (as a precaution)
	ant dist-all
	../mp2Dbuilder/installCDKIntoMaven (TODO: make Maven install script fail early if any jar installation fails)
	
Maven build
	In Eclipse, right-clicking on mp2dBuilder project, choose "Run As"-> Maven clean, followed by "Run As"->Maven package.
	In its current incarnation, when performing the "package" goal of Maven, a jar will be built specifically 
	for the ReactSmartsMoleculeViewer being the main class.
	The resulting jar can be found in the target directory and can be executed by issuing the following command:
	java -Dcdk.debugging=true -jar mp2Dbuilder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /home/podeus/dev/azWorkspace/mp2Dbuilder/src/test/resources/data/mdl/First500DB2005AllFields.rdf
