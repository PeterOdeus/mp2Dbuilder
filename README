Setup instructions (hints):

Hints: if Eclipse doesn't work the way you expect, here's the usual suspects of Eclipse: 
	clean, close&open project, restart using -clean flag... 
	
	When eclipse is complaining about maven dependency jars: Please make sure that the given dependency 
	jar file is "visible" inside the eclipse project ("Maven Dependencies").
		If jar file dependency is missing: make sure to run ../mp2Dbuilder/installCDKIntoMaven followed by
		AND/OR project right-click->Maven->Update Dependencies.
		If jar file is present, but pom.xml is marked red: try editing the pom file, then Undo and Save 
		before running "clean project".
	


Make sure Maven2 Eclipse plugin is installed:
	Eclipse update site: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update/
		Choose the following optional stuff (just to make sure):
			Central Repository index
			Integration for WTP
			POM Editor
			POM XML Editor


Add jchempaint jars to local Maven repo

	cd mp2Dbuilder/.. (jchempaint directory is assumed to be placed parallel with this project)
	git clone http://pele.farmbio.uu.se/git/jchempaint-primary.git/
	cd jchempaint-primary
	git checkout -b bc-2.1.x origin/bioclipse-2.1.x
	edit build.xml to generate source jar files when building:
		inside ant target "compile-module", append the following BEFORE "<!-- clean up afterwards -->":
			<jar jarfile="${dist}/jar/cdk-${module}-sources.jar">
				<fileset dir="${build.src}/${module}">
					<include name="**/*.java" />
				</fileset>
			</jar>
	ant dist-all
	../mp2Dbuilder/installCDKIntoMaven
